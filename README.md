# Detection-of-mask-wearing-status
Using object detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once)

In this project, the face_mask dataset originally contains over 800 images and is around 300MB in size. 
Due to its large size, it could not be uploaded to GitHub.

Therefore, I have manually selected and uploaded a compressed version containing only 50 sample images.

To run the code properly, you will need to store the full dataset locally on your own computer.

I have the complete dataset available, so if you need it, feel free to contact me via email at hoeyeon123@gmail.com.
